This project focuses on exploring, analyzing, and visualizing data related to dress attributes. Using various univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis techniques, insights are derived about patterns, trends, and relationships in the dataset. 

The project demonstrates proficiency in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization using Python.

**Features**:-

**Univariate Analysis**: Insights into individual attributes such as ratings, styles, and price categories.

**Bivariate Analysis**: Examines relationships between two attributes, e.g., price vs. recommendation or neckline vs. ratings.

**Multivariate Analysis**: Explores how multiple attributes, such as style, price, and season, influence recommendations.

Visualizations created using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
